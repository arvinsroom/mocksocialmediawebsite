# ModSimulator

ModSimulator is an open-source software tool designed to conduct experimental research on user behavior in response to social media content moderation interventions. This tool allows researchers to test specific moderation measures, such as fact-check footnotes and blur screens, which are widely used by platforms to limit misinformation spread and inform users about post accuracy.

Using ModSimulator, researchers can create a customized, interactive social media timeline that closely resembles a real-world platform, enabling them to add fact-check footnotes or blur screens to selected posts. This approach allows for the study of users' actual behavior in a realistic environment, rather than only relying on self-reported responses about encounters with misinformation.

ModSimulator is a customized fork of the [Mock Social Media Website Tool](https://docs.studysocial.media).
